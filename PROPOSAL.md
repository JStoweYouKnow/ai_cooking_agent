# Sous: From Recipe Inspiration to Real Meals

## The Problem

Home cooks today are drowning in recipe inspiration but struggling to turn that inspiration into actual meals. The problem isn't lack of content—it's the friction between finding a recipe and actually cooking it.

**The Recipe-to-Meal Gap:**
- Users save recipes from TikTok, Instagram, and food blogs with good intentions
- But the journey from "I want to make this" to "I cooked it" is filled with friction:
  1. Finding a recipe (easy)
  2. Saving it somewhere (easy)
  3. Planning when to cook it (hard)
  4. Figuring out what ingredients you need (hard)
  5. Generating a shopping list (hard)
  6. Actually cooking it (hardest)

**The Core Issue:** Context switching kills momentum. Jumping between apps (recipe → notes → shopping list → store) breaks the flow. By the time users manually convert ingredients into a shopping list, they've lost motivation to cook.

**The Result:** Beautiful recipe collections that never get cooked. Users end up ordering takeout instead of cooking the recipes they've saved.
