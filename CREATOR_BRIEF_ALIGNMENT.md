## What You Need to Do

### 1. Position Your App for Eitan's Audience

**Update your app description/proposal to:**
- Focus on the problem: "Home cooks save recipes but never cook them"
- Emphasize the solution: "Turn saved recipes into actual meals"
- Highlight features that solve Eitan's specific problem:
  - "Generate shopping lists from any recipe link"
  - "Organize your saved recipes into cookable meal plans"
  - "Go from inspiration to execution in one tap"

### 2. Update Creator Config (Optional Branding)

The creator integration I added is **optional** - it's just for visual branding if you want. You can:

**Option A: Keep it simple** - Just mention Eitan in your proposal/video  
**Option B: Add subtle branding** - Update `mobile/src/constants/creator.ts`:

```typescript
export const CREATOR_CONFIG: CreatorConfig = {
  name: "Eitan Bernath",
  handle: "@eitan",
  bio: "Food creator helping home cooks turn recipe inspiration into real meals",
  endorsement: "Finally, an app that helps you actually cook the recipes you save!",
  // ... rest
};
```

### 3. Focus Your Demo Video

In your demo video, emphasize:
1. **The Problem:** "You save recipes but never cook them"
2. **Your Solution:** Show how your app solves this:
   - Import recipe from URL → Auto-generate shopping list → Cook it
3. **Eitan's Audience:** "Perfect for home cooks who want to turn inspiration into action"
